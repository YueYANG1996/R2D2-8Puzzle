# R2D2-Project
This project was the term project of CIS 521 Artificial Intelligence at UPENN.
The Project include two parts -- 8-Puzzle Game & Multiple Goads Maze Search
The demo could be watch in: https://www.yueyang.host/copy-of-3d-reconstruction

The set-up process of the working enviroment in MacOS is available on: http://artificial-intelligence-class.org/r2d2_assignments/hw1/homework1.html

##R2D2 8-Puzzle Game##
This project uses A star algorithm to solve the 8 puzzle problem,
and visualized it via R2D2 platform.

###Function Description###

8puzzle_connect.py -- connect to the 8 robots (Attentation: most computer could only connect to 5-6 robots simultaneously, you need to disconnect and reconnect to new robots in some cases.)

puzzleAstar.py -- generate the path to solve the problem, the output includes the # of robot and its movements in order.

puzzlesuccessors.py -- generate the successors given current state

puzzlemove.py and puzzleaction.py -- convert the path generated by Astar to commands of actual robots
